PETER - Public transport nETwork simulation Environment for R
=============================================================

The peter package provides a modular interface for accessing public
transport real-time data and simulate the underlying network's
characteristics.

Along with defining a common data format and importing different data
sources to it, visualization and data handling utilities are provided.

The center piece of peter, however, is an environment to facilitate
the simulation of the transit network specifics.

Currently, only data handlers for Vienna's Wiener Linien are
implemented.
